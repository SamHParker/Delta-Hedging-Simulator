# Delta-Hedging-Simulator
A Python script that simulates the dynamic delta hedging of a long call option. This project investigates the P&amp;L of a hedging strategy and how it is driven by the difference between the implied volatility, used for option pricing and hedging, and the realised volatility of the simulated path.
